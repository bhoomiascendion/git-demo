## Ipsum Below


The word Lorem Ipsum is derived from the Latin word which means “pain itself”. It is a kind of a text filler tool that is used by the webmaster on the website.

Basically, this tool is used to create dummy content on the website when it’s new.


It helps the designer plan where the content will sit. It helps in creating drafts of the content on the pages of the website. It originates from the Latin text but is seen as gibberish.

Sometimes, the reader gets distracted while creating or working on the website. That’s why this language is important.

This tool makes the work easier for the webmaster.
